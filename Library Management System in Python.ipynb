    "\n",
    "This project implements a library management system in Python. It allows \n",
    "users to perform various operations such as adding books, removing books, \n",
    "displaying all books, searching for books by title, updating book details, \n",
    "borrowing books, and returning books.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is implemented using object-oriented programming principles.\n",
    "It consists of two main classes:`Book` and`Library`.The `Book` class represents \n",
    "a book with attributes like title, author, publication year, and availability status. \n",
    "The `Library` class represents the library and provides methods to add, remove, \n",
    "display, search, update, borrow, and return books.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with the library management system, the program displays a menu of options \n",
    "to the user. Users can enter the corresponding numbers to select an option. \n",
    "Each option triggers the relevant functionality, allowing users to manage the \n",
    "library effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to customize the code or add more features to suit your requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy managing your library!\n"
